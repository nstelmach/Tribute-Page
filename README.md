# Tribute Page FreeCodeCamp

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/nstelmach/pen/wvgQGrw](https://codepen.io/nstelmach/pen/wvgQGrw).

The goal of this project was to learn HTML and CSS. I focused on building a tribute page. I was supposed to use tags such as main, figure, img, attributes such as target, and CSS properties such as max-width and height. Many tags were supposed to have an id. In the future, I plan to refactor styles into classes using BEM naming convention, use CSS Reset and increase availability by adding appropriate aria labels.
